# Write a Python program to get the 4th element and 4th element from last of a tuple.

#Get an item of the tuple
tuplex = ("S", "u", "d", "h", "i", "n", "G", "e", "o", "r", "g", "e")
print(tuplex)
#Get item (4th element)of the tuple by index
item = tuplex[3]
print("4th element: ",item)
#Get item (4th element from last)by index negative
item1 = tuplex[-4]
print("4th element from last: ",item1)
